Welcome to my dotfiles!  
I've shared my dunst, i3, kitty, neofetch, picom, polybar, rofi, xborders, and polybar-scripts.  
I don't provide a installer for my setup you can take a look at the config files, download them, and if you want to share them please give my credit  
I made the configs for my self so if somethings does not works it probably have a path like /home/Fuya/.config/...   
  
Also in the /wallpaper/ folder I uploaded my wallpaper collection, and in the /scripts/ folder there is a little script that I made for changing the wallpaper from terminal.
